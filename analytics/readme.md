# Analysis
These scripts are meant to take raw text corpora as input, wrangle/vectorize them to the extent that acquisition scrips have not, and perform various analytics about the text itself (such as readability or topic modeling, etc). The output has to be usable for visualization scripts.

Non-NLP scripts in this folder are for taking in JSON or CSV data. In many cases, data acquired through APIs can be passed directly into one of the visualization scripts.
