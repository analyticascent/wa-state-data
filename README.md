# WA State Data
These are experimental scripts for analyzing scraped text from http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/ and [Socrata API](https://dev.socrata.com/) data from https://data.wa.gov/

The goals are to enable data *acquisition* (through web scraping or API requests), *text analysis,* or *visualization* of various features of legal code as well as relationships between variables documented in the Socrata APIs. For laws (the RCW text), I intend analyze how accessible the text is to a general audience based on [Federal Plain Language Guidelines](http://www.plainlanguage.gov/howto/guidelines/FederalPLGuidelines/index.cfm) as well as more simple metrics such as the [Fleschâ€“Kincaid readability tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesch%E2%80%93Kincaid_readability_tests).
